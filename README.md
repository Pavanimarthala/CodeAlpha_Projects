# CodeAlpha_Project
 Welcome to my repository! In this repository, I will upload the Data Science  projects that I complete during my Code Alpha internship.

# Project Overview

# 1 Iris_flower_classification 
 Goal: Build and  evaluate a model that predicts the species of an iris flower from four measurements : sepal length,sepal width,petal length and petal width.

    The iris dataset is a classic introductory dataset for supervised learning and classification. This project is ideal for demonstrating the full ML workflow:EDA----> preprocessing-->modeling-->evaluation-->deployment-ready artifact.

# Unemployment 

    Unemployment refers to the situation where people who are willing and able to work are unable to find a job.It is one of the most important idicators of a country's economic health,as it reflects the availability of jobs, economivc growth,and thw well-being i=of the working population.
 
 # Car Price Prediction 

    Car price prediction  is a machine learning task where a model is trained to estimate the selling price of a car based on it's features such as brand, model year,mileage, fuel type,engine capacity,and other specificstions.

# 1 🛠️ Tools Used 
  # - Python
  # - jupyter Notebook /Google colab
  
# 2 Data handling and Preprocessing 
 - Pandas - data loading,cleaning,preprocessing
 - Numpy - mathematical operations and array handling

 - 
# 3 data visualization
 Matplotlib – charts (bar, line, scatter)

Seaborn – statistical visualizations (pairplot, heatmap, distributions)

 # 4. Machine Learning Libraries
Scikit-learn (sklearn)

Used for:

Splitting data (train-test split)

Preprocessing (StandardScaler, LabelEncoder, OneHotEncoder)

ML models:

Classification (Iris project)

Regression (Car price prediction)

Optional models for unemployment analysis

Evaluation metrics: accuracy, MAE, MSE, RMSE, etc.
